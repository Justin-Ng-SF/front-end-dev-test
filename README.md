    Struggles: 
While working on this project, most of my time spent was moreso from fine tuning the css to match the mockup and then testing it out on different resolutions. I did have trouble for a few new things such as the use of a carousel as I have not implemented one before and I had to override a bit of the css for it so that it would fit properly.

    What I enjoyed:
The reason why I want to become a Web Developer/Front-End Developer is because I enjoy being able to visually see my progress. While working on this project, it was enjoyable seeing each section being finished and being stacked on each other like a lego block. I also found it fun to just fine tune the css to match the mockup as it felt like I was trying completing a puzzle.
